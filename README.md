# Students-Deliberative-Forum
## INTRODUCTION
The year of 2020 will definitely be remembered for the Corona Virus outbreak and how it brought certain changes in our lives. The world came to a standstill when the lockdown was implemented. The concept of work from home was introduced and online classes became mandatory for students.The online classes have been going on since 6 months and it has not made the lives of the students any easier. Some may argue that we can sit comfortably in our houses and since we need not travel to our colleges or schools it has helped us to save a lot of time. The flip side is that the amount of issues and inconvenience it has brought to students have also increased and there is no proper platform for the students to express their doubts and concerns.

## SOFTWARES USED
For our project, we are using a platform called XAMPP. It is a free end open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package. On the front-end we are using HTML ( Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and for the back-end we are using PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor). The database used here is MySQL. It is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
